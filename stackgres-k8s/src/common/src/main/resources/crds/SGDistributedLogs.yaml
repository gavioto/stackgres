                    Name of the Distributed Logs cluster. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.

                    A Distributed Logs cluster may store logs for zero or more SGClusters.

                    The name must be unique across all Distributed Logs and StackGres clusters in the same namespace. The full cluster name includes the namespace in which the cluster is created.

                            description: |
                              Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint
                              keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to
                              match all values and all keys.
                          operator:
                            type: string
                            description: |
                              Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists
                              and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that
                              a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                          value:
                            type: string
                            description: |
                              Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the
                              value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
                          effect:
                            type: string
                            description: |
                              Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                              When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
                          tolerationSeconds:
                            type: integer
                            description: |
                              TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of
                              effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        It is a best practice, on non-containerized environments, when running production workloads, to run each database server on a different server (virtual or physical), i.e., not to co-locate more than one database server per host.

                        The same best practice applies to databases on containers. By default, StackGres will not allow to run more than one StackGres or Distributed Logs pod on a given Kubernetes node. If set to `true` it will allow more than one StackGres pod per node.
